Algorithm :

1. Take total no of test cases from the user check its validity.

2. Find the maximum and minimum no of legs in each cases.
i. To find max no of legs = 4 * no of cat + 4 * no of dog 

ii. To find min no of legs =  4 * no of dog

3. check if no of legs is equal to no in its range. If equal print yes otherwise print no.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for no of test cases.
